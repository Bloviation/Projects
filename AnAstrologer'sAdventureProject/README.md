This is an original Metroidvania action platformer that I designed and implemented. 
While it is not in a finished state and the collisions can be janky at times, everything included works. 
The game is beatable and full of ideas that came to me during development. 
It is by far my biggest project, taking about 3-4 months of diligent work to create.

The central gimmick is that the player needs to draw zodiac symbols using their mouse while focusing on platforming and dodging hazards in their surroundings. 
While I am currently taking a sizable break from the project, I plan to revisit it in the future to expand and refine it further once Iâ€™ve improved my skills.

This project pushed my abilities to their absolute limit. 
I had to design an entire room and door system to allow the game to run smoothly, create over 10 unique enemy AIs, build more than 20 unique rooms, implement 5+ zodiac abilities, and add a save-and-quit feature. 
Each of these elements came with a slew of bugs I had to deal with and many implementation challenges.

While this is primarily a passion project, it also served as a valuable practice exercise. 
I wanted to continually push the boundaries of what I could achieve, adding features like rooms larger than the screen, hidden secrets, and multiple abilities without overcomplicating the controls. 
With an improved collision system, enhanced sprites, and some additional polish, I believe there is a solid game in what I have created.

The "Animator", "Sprite", and "Serializer" files are support tools created by my father to assist me in this project.
The "ZodiacDraw" and "GlobLevelEditor" files are support tools jointly created by my father and me to assist with this project.
The "Glob" file serves as the main file from which everything is executed, while files like "Mines" and "Desert" represent biomes within the game.
The "GlobLevelEditor" file enables me to efficiently create and adjust rooms without needing to repeatedly close and restart the program.
