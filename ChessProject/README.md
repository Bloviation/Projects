This is an offline, fully functional chess game. 
It includes features such as legal move indicators, stalemate and checkmate detection, and support for all legal chess moves, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

Developing this game was a valuable learning exercise, as it marked the first time I worked extensively with inheritance. 
Setting up the board itself wasnâ€™t particularly difficult, but making all the pieces move correctly and display their legal moves proved challenging.

This project required me not only to engage with a concept I was unfamiliar with but also to strengthen my foundational programming skills. 
I had to manage numerous dynamic variables, each with its own unique properties, which pushed me to think critically and improve my overall approach to problem-solving.

The "Animator" and "Sprite" files are support tools created by my father to assist me in this project.
