This is an almost perfect recreation of the classic mobile game Minesweeper. 
With the exception of the timer, every feature is included.

When developing this game, I encountered challenges that were the opposite of those in my chess project. 
While creating the gameplay itself wasn’t particularly difficult, generating the board proved to be quite tricky. 
Unlike chess, Minesweeper’s board is inconsistent and only follows a few rules, the most challenging being that the first square clicked cannot be a mine. 
To address this, I made the board generate based on the mouse’s initial click location, guaranteeing that the first square is always safe.

Although coding the gameplay was relatively easier compared to generating the board, it still presented its own difficulties. 
For example, implementing the auto-reveal system for empty squares required me to track progress dynamically. 
I accomplished this using an array list combined with a while loop to manage the system’s logic effectively.

This project not only helped solidify my foundational programming skills but also introduced me to new concepts that have greatly benefited my work on larger projects.
